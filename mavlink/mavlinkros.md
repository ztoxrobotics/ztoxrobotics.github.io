# ROS integration

This section evaluates the integration of a MAVLink-based autopilot with ROS, *the Robot Operative System* ( see [ROS section](../ros/ROS.md)). For this purpose, three ROS packages are evaluated:

- [mavlink_ros](ros/mavlink_ros.md) ROS package
- [autopilot_bridge](ros/autopilot_bridge.md) ROS package
- [mavros](ros/mavros.md) ROS package (didn't compile)
- [roscopter](ros/roscopter.md) ROS package
