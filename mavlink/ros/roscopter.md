# roscopter

[roscopter](https://github.com/cberzan/roscopter) is a ROS package that implements ROS interface for Arducopter using Mavlink 1.0 interface. It supports controlling the arducopter by overriding the RC command, and it publishes all the sensor data (old package available [here](https://code.google.com/p/roscopter/)).

#### Compiling `autopilot_bridge`

Compilation is performed as described in the [mavlink_ros:compiling instructions](mavlink_ros.md). The package should be downloaded into `~/catkin_ws/src` and `catkin_make` should be called from `catkin_ws` (refer to [ROS: Building a ROS Package](../../ros/tutorials/building_a_ros_package.md) for learning more about ROS package compilation).

Exact instructions for this package are provided with its [source code](https://github.com/cberzan/roscopter).


### Running `roscopter`

```bash
rosrun roscopter roscopter_node.py  --device=/dev/ttyO4 --baudrate=115200
```

```bash
root:~# rosrun roscopter roscopter_node.py  --device=/dev/ttyO5 --baudrate=115200
Waiting for APM heartbeat
Heartbeat from APM (system 1 component 1)
Sending all stream request for rate 10


```

`roscopter` can also be launched using a socket over the network:
```
rosrun roscopter roscopter_node.py  --device tcp:127.0.0.1:6000  --baudrate=115200
```

#### Visualizing `roscopter`

![node-graph](../../img/mavlinkROS/roscopter_graph.png)

Let's start visualizing the topic `/attitude` values and its graphical representation:

---

**Through all this process the board has been static on our desk. The bad results are not due to the bad performance of the ROS package but to problems with the attitude estimation inside of ArduPilot.**

---

`rostopic echo /attitude`
![](../../img/mavlinkROS/roscopter_values1.png)
and a plot using `rqt_plot /attitude/roll:pitch:yaw:rollspeed:pitchspeed:yawspeed`
![](../../img/mavlinkROS/roscopter_plot1.png)

These values are a bit unexpected so we repeat the process taking several screenshots:
`rostopic echo /attitude`
![](../../img/mavlinkROS/roscopter_values2.png)
`rqt_plot /attitude/roll:pitch:yaw:rollspeed:pitchspeed:yawspeed`
![](../../img/mavlinkROS/roscopter_plot21.png)
`rqt_plot /attitude/roll:pitch:yaw:rollspeed:pitchspeed:yawspeed`
![](../../img/mavlinkROS/roscopter_plot22.png)
`rqt_plot /attitude/roll:pitch:yaw:rollspeed:pitchspeed:yawspeed`
![](../../img/mavlinkROS/roscopter_plot23.png)

Seems we have an issue with the attitude :(.

*On the other hand topic `/raw_imu` values cannot be visualized*
